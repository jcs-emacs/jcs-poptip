This package tries to show the information as hard as possible. Think of this as
an all-in-one package. It uses these packages to grab the information:

- [lsp-ui-doc][] - LSP is smart so don't often need to try other solutions.
- `describe-thing` - Built-in describe thing at point
- [company-dict][] - Like built-in `describe-thing` but try to show information
from completion dictionary.
- [preview-it][] - Preview `file`, `image`, `url`, and color at the point.
- [define-it][] - Define, translate wiki the word.
